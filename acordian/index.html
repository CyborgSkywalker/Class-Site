                A race called the Quintessons resurrect Prime as part of a plot to steal the Matrix of Leadership. Hot Rod willingly gives it back to Prime, not knowing that he's under the control of others. Once Prime has it, he turns on the rest of the Autobots. This could be where we see him attacking Bumblebee. Prime is able to eventually overcome the control, so we know the real him is still somewhat conscious, which could explain Prime apologizing to Bumblebee during the attack.</p>

            Optimus and Bumblebee remain close friends. They have a history together during the war on Cybertron and on Earth. Bumblebee accompanied Optimus to Earth. He was one of the few to do so and soon enough, fought by his side in the Autobots' battle to destroy the evil forces of the Decepticons. Bumblebee took part in a mission alongside Optimus to fight against Skyquake. Optimus proved his compassion for Bumblebee as he carefully looked after him and later complimented his tactics after the battle. After Optimus fell victim to Cybonic plague, Bumblebee went onto the Nemesis and risked his own life to retrieve a cure. After Optimus was cured, he stopped everyone from applauding him and told them to instead clap for both Bumblebee and Ratchet.
